nuxt/ vue universal app
- running ant design as well https://www.antdv.com/components/steps/
- this is overkill but whatever
- two views but no redirects
- just a form that rerenders with results
- should not consume env file

servermiddleware
- servermiddleware does not bundle the nuxt config
- requires env file
- api key in env file
- calls the spotify api and does things

create-nuxt-app config
